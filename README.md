## Food Recipe App

This app allows you to get data on all kinds of dishes from different countries of the world from a free [Edamam API](https://www.edamam.com/).

Next, the process of the application is demonstrated when the user enters the name of the dish, in our case it is pizza and receives 20 recipes with detailed information and the opportunity to see the recipe itself.

### 1 version

Also in the next version (version 2), not only the color solutions concerning the design of the website were changed, but also the possibility of its adaptability was taken into account not only for various mobile devices, but also for tablets in particular. Since due to the rapid development of technology, you should not lose sight of the moment.
