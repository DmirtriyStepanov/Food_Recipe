# FoodRecipe

In the course of learning the JS language, I completed an application project related to cooking recipes.

In this application, the user has the opportunity to enter the name of the dish in the search. As a result of the search, the user will receive a list of 20 possible recipes for this dish.

Data on cooking recipes can be obtained by using a third-party service (Food API).
